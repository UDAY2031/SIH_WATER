# HydroScape
- ### We created a web-based water forecasting system aimed at predicting future water requirements and assessing reservoir storage capacities.
- ### Our solution leverages AI and machine learning to forecast water demand across different sectors and manage water resources efficiently.
- ### The system is designed to assist decision-makers by providing real-time visualizations, accurate predictions, and simulations of extreme scenarios like droughts and floods, ensuring sustainable water management practices.

## Models used are:
```
- Time-series Model(SARIMA), Prophet
- Multi-Regression + Random Forest
- Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)
```

## Dataset Parameters used:
